Hi! My name is James Parry, a recent PhD graduate in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Bath. Sponsored by Siemens-Energy, my research involved the numerical modelling of gas turbine compressors. Part of the Turbomachinery Research Centre, my supervision team consisted of Dr. Mauro Carnevale, Dr. James Scobie, Dr. Hui Tang and Prof. Gary Lock.

I previously obtained my Master's of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Bath, with my thesis on the optimisation of tiltrotor UAS propellers.

Research
======
I am a multidisciplinery researcher in the field of aerospace engineering, specialising in numerical modelling and simulation. My research focuses on the development of open-source CFD software for modelling fluid flow and heat transfer in gas turbine compressors, developing coupled conjugate heat transfer (CHT)/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code in OpenFOAM. 

I also have a keen interest in UAS related research, with experience in the developement of code for optimising propellers for tiltrotor UAS.

Extra
======
Outside of academia I am an avid football player. As captain of the Department of Engineering football team in 2019/20 and the post-graduate team in 2021/22 and 2022/23, winning the departmental league in 2021/22.
